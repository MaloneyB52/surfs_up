Oahu is perfect for surfing! Even intermittent rain showers should not stop investment. Even a 
low of 54, does not preclude surfing. We suggest this may actually indicate a need for wet suits sales in December, opening up another SKU item for sale in the shop
Precipitation in June spikes in afternoon but doesn’t last all day…their surfers are getting wet anyway!
